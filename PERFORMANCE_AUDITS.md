# Performance audit notes

Performance audit history for this repository, newest first. Every entry is a
record of what was measured, what was fixed, and what the numbers were at the
time; the methodology for taking new measurements — which benchmark to trust,
how to profile the sanitized and Release trees, how to symbolize — stays in
the "Benchmarking and diagnostics" section of `AGENTS.md`.

**Read the newest entry before starting performance work.** It carries the
reference points the next audit is measured against, the finds that were
deliberately left untaken, and the mistakes an earlier audit already paid for.
When an audit lands, add a new dated entry at the top and leave the older ones
as written — they are a record, not documentation to keep current.

`2026-08-08c` (Linux x86_64, same method as `2026-08-08b`: `perf record -F 999
--call-graph fp`, instruction counts from `STEP_INSTRUCTIONS` and `perf stat -e
instructions`, every quoted number from a clang-built binary; buster-compiled
stage executables were used for fixed-point validation only). Seven commits:
stage 1 `16.999 G` to `12.713 G` instructions (`-25.2%`, wall `2.38 s` to
`1.83 s`), sanitized `ide test` `331.97 G` to `246.05 G` (`-25.9%`), Release
`ide test` `21.70 G` to `15.21 G` (`-29.9%`), at the byte-identical fixed point
with all 29 modules passing in Release and sanitized Debug and `ide bench`
unchanged (`BENCH_IO` median `~272 us`, `BENCH_PARSE` median `~98 us`,
`files=61`).

- **Four more translation-unit quadratics in `c_lower_to_ir`, all the shape the
  previous entries predicted** — a per-item query answered by rescanning a
  whole table. In fix order, with stage 1 after each: the per-function local
  count scanned every entity per lowered definition (`13.2%` of samples; one
  bucketing pass, `16.999 G` to `16.813 G` but wall `-11%` — the scan was
  memory-bound, so the win is time, not instructions); the string-literal
  array-bound inference scanned every declaration per unresolved array type
  from inside the round/pass/type fixpoint nest (CSR bucket of object
  declarations by type, `16.813 G` to `15.213 G`); five symbol/global passes
  joined declarations to entities by rescanning all declarations per entity
  (one CSR by entity, `15.213 G` to `14.371 G`); and
  `c_parse_scope_for_token` answered "deepest scope under root holding this
  token" by scanning every scope in the unit and walking each candidate's
  ancestors (`4.3%` of samples but `11.6%` of instructions — a
  children-by-parent index descended from the root instead, `14.371 G` to
  `12.706 G`; the during-parse static-assert caller keeps the linear scan
  because scopes are still growing there). Sample share and instruction share
  disagree in both directions across these — profile *and* count.
- **The x86 metadata module's remaining cost was rescanning and re-deriving
  static data per query.** Three commits, sanitized `ide test` after each:
  `string_offset_terminated` re-found each string's NUL by linear scan per
  call, mostly `physical_register_view` asking the same atom's length once per
  literal in its ~50-entry chain — a distance-to-NUL table filled in one
  backward pass at decode makes it one read (`331.97 G` to `306.80 G`);
  `copy_form` re-tokenized the form's whole pattern to normalize
  prefix/family metadata and filtering ran it per candidate per iteration —
  normalized forms are now cached per id (`306.80 G` to `277.32 G`); emit and
  coverage paths still re-parsed patterns per call and the test helper
  `x86_64_metadata_test_string_contains` compared all needle bytes at every
  offset — pattern semantics are memoized per form id behind a seed-field
  guard (a fabricated or edited form parses fresh) and the probe rejects on
  the first byte (`277.32 G` to `246.05 G`). `x86_64_metadata_tests`:
  sanitized `5.77 s` to `1.59 s`, Release `529 ms` to `166 ms`.
- Stage-1 profile after all fixes is genuinely flat: `c_lower_to_ir` fell from
  `26%` of samples to under `1.2%`, and no function exceeds `5%` (`c_lex`
  `4.9%`, `codegen_generate_canonical_module` `4.8%`,
  `object_from_canonical_codegen_module` `4.6%`). Sanitized shape:
  `__asan_memcpy` `~21%` (diffuse), `string_equal` `8.3%`
  (`c_parse_apply_vector_attribute` `2.4%`, `c_ir_type_name_prefix` `1.9%`,
  `c_parse_aggregate_lookup` `1.6%`), `c_ir_lower_assignment_statement_step`
  `5.0%`, `c_token_is_punctuator` `4.4%`.
- **Known remaining find, deliberately not taken:** `c_parse_aggregate_lookup`
  scans every type per tag lookup during parsing. It needs an incrementally
  maintained `(kind, tag)` hash index in `CParseResult` (the
  `entity_lookup_buckets`/`typedef_lookup_buckets` pattern), returning the
  oldest match; worth ~1.6% sanitized plus some parse-time stage 1. The
  remaining `string_equal` sites are spelling predicates — re-read the
  `2026-08-08` warning before touching them; only removing comparisons wins.
- Reference points for the next audit, all clang-built: stage 1 `12.713 G`,
  sanitized `ide test` `246.05 G` (`c_frontend_tests` `9.6 s`,
  `x86_64_metadata_tests` `1.6 s`), Release `ide test` `15.21 G`
  (`c_frontend_tests` `780-870 ms` run-to-run — quote instructions, not this
  wall spread), Release `BENCH_IO` median `272-280 us`, `BENCH_PARSE` median
  `98-100 us` at `files=61`. Stage 2 fell `262.2 G` to `187.7 G` — quoted as
  self-hosting validation only, since it runs on a buster-compiled stage 1.

`2026-08-08b` (Linux x86_64, `perf record -F 999 --call-graph fp`, instruction
counts from `STEP_INSTRUCTIONS` and `perf stat -e instructions`). Two
configurations were audited together for the first time: **compile throughput**
(clang-built Release `ide` compiling the unity TU, the `Self-host stage 1` step)
and the sanitized Debug `ide test` CI critical path. Every number here comes
from a clang-built binary; buster-compiled stage executables are self-hosting
validation only and none of their timings are quoted. Net result across six
commits: stage 1 `27.436 G` to `17.000 G` instructions (`-38.0%`, `3.19 s` to
`2.16 s`) and sanitized `ide test` `430.25 G` to `332.16 G` (`-22.8%`), at the
byte-identical self-host fixed point with all 29 modules passing in both
configurations and `ide bench` unchanged throughout.

- **Five whole-table scans, four of them quadratic, in one audit.** Each was a
  query answered by re-deriving a global property per item, and each is the
  shape the `2026-08-08` entry below told the next audit to look for. In the
  order they were fixed, with the stage 1 instruction count after each:
  - `c_ir_type_is_flexible_array` scanned every type and every member of every
    aggregate, from depth 5 inside the `type_mapping_round` / `pass` /
    `type_index` fixpoint nest — `21.2%` of the compile on its own.
    `c_ir_collect_flexible_array_types` marks the set once per round.
    `27.436 G` to `21.216 G` (`-22.7%`).
  - `c_ir_incomplete_array_has_initializer` scanned every declaration and every
    entity, once per array type. Now indexed by type in one pass.
    `21.216 G` to `20.549 G` (`-3.1%`).
  - `c_ir_function_signature` called `ir_prepare_program_abi`, sweeping every
    type in the program, once per function declaration. Removed outright:
    every ABI read outside the resolver goes through `ir_type_abi_value`,
    which resolves on demand, so the sweep was pre-warming only. `20.549 G` to
    `19.666 G` (`-4.3%`).
  - `c_ir_label_metadata_store_for_place` scanned every value in the function
    on every store, relocating each place to ask whether it shared the root
    just written. Places are now filed once into an intrusive list headed by
    their root. `19.672 G` to `17.000 G` (`-13.6%`), and sanitized `ide test`
    `366.44 G` to `332.16 G` (`-9.4%`) — it was the one hotspot both
    configurations shared.
  - `x86_64_metadata` string consumers read the pool one
    `buster_x86_metadata_string_byte` call per byte. See below.
- **The optimizer's inline hint does not exist in the tree CI measures.**
  `BUSTER_INLINE` expanded to nothing when `BUSTER_OPTIMIZE` was off, so the
  already-decoded guard `c343ab8` added to `buster_x86_metadata_decode_tables`
  was still an out-of-line call in sanitized Debug, at `3.2%` of `ide test`.
  That commit's sanitized win came from shrinking the guard's `-O0` frame, not
  from inlining. `BUSTER_ALWAYS_INLINE` now holds in every configuration and
  `BUSTER_INLINE` is defined in terms of it; `nm` on the sanitized Debug `ide`
  no longer lists the guard. Worth `-0.9%`. Reserve the new spelling for
  one-test guards on per-byte or per-record paths — forcing a large body inline
  everywhere costs Debug compile time and steppability.
- **The decoded string pool is contiguous, so stop reading it a byte at a
  time.** The one-time decode already flattens the chunked generated pool into
  a host array, but every consumer still went `string_byte` -> `pool_byte` ->
  the decode guard: three calls per byte over a `1.7 MB` pool, roughly `27%` of
  the sanitized run across substring searches, NUL scans, and the pattern
  tokenizer that walks all `11013` forms. `buster_x86_metadata_pool_span` /
  `_string_span` hand out a view once. Sanitized `ide test` `424.46 G` to
  `366.44 G` (`-13.7%`), `x86_64_metadata_tests` `8.21 s` to `5.17 s` (`-37%`).
  `string_span` is public because the metadata tests are a separate translation
  unit in non-unity builds.
- **A correct incremental fix can still be worthless; measure it.** The first
  attempt at the ABI sweep resumed from the longest already-resolved prefix,
  which is sound because a resolved ABI is never invalidated. It measured
  `-0.2%` and left `c_ir_function_signature` at `6.1%` of the profile, because
  `ir_resolve_type_abi` returns without resolving when a type's layout is
  unresolved, so one early incomplete type pins the prefix near zero. Profiling
  after the change, not just before it, is what caught this.
- Shares after all six commits, stage 1 out of `17.000 G`: `c_lower_to_ir`
  `24.3%`, `c_lex` `4.6%`, `c_ir_body_task_set_loop_cleanup_targets` `4.1%`,
  `object_from_canonical_codegen_module` `3.9%`,
  `codegen_generate_canonical_module` `3.6%`, `c_ir_lower_frame_fallback`
  `2.8%`. No single quadratic dominates any more and the profile is flat.
- Shares after all six commits, sanitized `ide test` out of `332.16 G`:
  `__asan_memcpy` `19.5%`, `string_equal` `7.1%`,
  `buster_x86_metadata_string_offset_terminated` `6.4%`,
  `buster_x86_metadata_emit_token_equal` `5.7%`,
  `x86_64_metadata_test_string_contains` `4.2%`,
  `c_ir_lower_assignment_statement_step` `4.1%`, `c_token_is_punctuator`
  `2.7%`. Module totals `c_frontend_tests` `8.70 s` and
  `x86_64_metadata_tests` `5.23 s`. `string_offset_terminated` *rose* in share
  because the run shrank around it: it re-finds a NUL from an offset every time
  a record's string length is wanted, and caching the length in the decoded
  record is the obvious next step.
- Reference points for the next audit, all clang-built: Release `ide test`
  `c_frontend_tests` `693 ms`, `x86_64_metadata_tests` `517 ms`. Release
  `ide bench` `BENCH_IO` median `263 us`, `BENCH_PARSE` median `92 us` — both
  unchanged by every commit here, which is the expected result and was checked
  each time rather than assumed.
- Process note: `--sanitize` is a sticky `generate`-time flag. A measurement
  script that runs the sanitized pass last and then measures Release without
  `--no-sanitize` silently profiles a sanitized tree; self-host aborts in
  `ld.so` and Release test times triple. Also do not build while a measurement
  runs — two overlapping runs produce plausible wall times that are pure
  contention. Instruction counts survive both mistakes; wall times do not.

`2026-08-08` (Linux x86_64, sanitized Debug clang, `perf record -F 999
--call-graph fp`, `25650` samples, instruction counts from `perf stat -e
instructions`). Supersedes the shares in the `2026-08-07` entry below, whose
mechanism was fixed by `23a574e`: `CToken` no longer crosses the spelling
predicates by value, and ASan memcpy shadow scanning is `8.8%` of the run
rather than half of `c_frontend_tests`.

- **A lazily-decoded table's guard cost 20% of the whole test suite.**
  `buster_x86_metadata_decode_tables` decodes once behind
  `buster_x86_metadata_tables_decoded`, but every accessor called it
  out-of-line, including the per-byte string accessors, so the decode was free
  and the already-decoded test was not. Splitting it into a `BUSTER_INLINE`
  test plus a cold `buster_x86_metadata_decode_tables_once` body moved the run
  from `678.81 G` to `537.66 G` instructions (`-20.8%`) and `32.93 s` to
  `25.80 s`; `x86_64_metadata_tests` `14.90 s` to `8.25 s` (`-45%`) and
  `assembly_tests` `1.10 s` to `0.66 s` (`-40%`). Self-hosting stays at the
  byte-identical fixed point. Look for this shape wherever a self-initializing
  accessor is called per byte or per record.
- Module shares after that change: `c_frontend_tests` `61.6%` (`15.79 s`),
  `x86_64_metadata_tests` `31.8%` (`8.25 s`), `assembly_tests` `2.6%`. Before
  it the two were effectively tied (`15.79 s` against `14.90 s`), so
  "`c_frontend_tests` is the largest cost" became true only once the metadata
  module was fixed.
- **The sanitized tree runs UBSan as well as ASan, so each instrumented
  struct-field access costs roughly 20 instructions** — an inline
  `__ubsan_handle_type_mismatch_v1` null/alignment test plus an ASan shadow
  test. `c_token_is_punctuator` is 94 instructions and `string_equal` is 274.
  The consequence is counter-intuitive and was measured three times: **splitting
  an aggregate into separate field accesses is slower than passing it by
  value**, because the by-value copy is one instrumented `memcpy` while each
  field read pays the full pair of checks. Against a `678.81 G` baseline, a
  length/first-byte fast path in `c_token_spelling_equal` measured `695.19 G`,
  the same path with `BUSTER_INLINE` on both predicates `701.03 G`, and routing
  the comparison through a scalar-argument helper `577.96 G` against the
  `537.66 G` state it was applied to. All three were reverted. Do not retry a
  local rewrite of these predicates; only removing the comparison entirely wins.
- **Giving the token a `CPunctuator` id removed another 20% of the suite.**
  `c_token_is_punctuator` reaching `string_equal` had been `14.1%` of the whole
  run, `~19%` counting its own frame and `string_equal`'s ASan fake stack, from
  `1155` call sites over a closed set of 56 spellings. `c_punctuator_length`
  now returns the id it already matched, `CToken` carries it in a `u16` that
  shares the word `pack_alignment` used to own — so `CToken` stays 48 bytes,
  locked by a `BUSTER_CT_CHECK` — and the predicate is `token->punctuator ==
  punctuator`. The run went from `537.91 G` to `430.69 G` instructions
  (`-19.9%`), `24.98 s` to `20.9-21.8 s`; `c_frontend_tests` `15.27 s` to
  `10.7-11.4 s` (`-26%`, and quote the instruction count instead — the wall-time
  spread across two runs of the identical binary is that wide). Compile
  throughput moved with it: self-host stage 1 `29.50 G` to `27.25 G` (`-7.6%`)
  and stage 2 `442.85 G` to `394.65 G` (`-10.9%`), at the byte-identical fixed
  point.
- Two properties make the single compare sound, and a change that breaks either
  one is silently wrong rather than loud. **Only a `C_TOKEN_PUNCTUATOR` token
  may carry a nonzero id**, so the predicate needs no kind test; every site that
  retypes an existing token assigns `punctuator` alongside `kind`.
  **Digraphs keep ids distinct from the punctuators they spell** (`<:` is not
  `[`), because every caller was asking about a spelling. The one place that
  edits a spelling in flight, `c_ir_compound_assignment_operator`, drops the
  `'='` and hands the result to the spelling-driven `c_conditional_operator`, so
  it clears the id that no longer describes it.
- Converting the punctuator tests that went through `c_token_spelling_equal`
  was worth `0.04%` (`430.84 G` to `430.68 G`): they sit on the directive path,
  not the hot loop. It was kept for the invariant, not the number. The
  `C_CONDITIONAL_MATCH` chain in `c_conditional_operator` is still a linear walk
  of string compares and was deliberately left alone — it does not appear in the
  profile, and converting it means reworking the spelling truncation above.
- After the change `string_equal` is `5.6%` and no longer punctuator work: it is
  `c_parse_apply_vector_attribute` and `c_ir_type_name_prefix` matching keywords
  and type names. The largest single buster frame is now
  `c_ir_label_metadata_store_for_place` at `7.4%`, and module shares are
  `c_frontend_tests` `51.5%` (`10.72 s`) against `x86_64_metadata_tests` `39.9%`
  (`8.31 s`) — the two modules are close to tied again, so the next audit should
  not assume the C frontend is where the time is.
- Self-host stage ratio, for the canonical codegen path that runs no register
  allocation: stage 1 `3.45 s` / `29.50 G` instructions, stage 2 `37.96 s` /
  `442.85 G`. That is `11.0x` by wall time but `15.0x` by instructions retired;
  quote the instruction ratio, since wall time on this host varies ~10%.

`2026-08-07` (Linux x86_64, sanitized Debug clang, `perf record -F 999
--call-graph fp` on a quiet host, `65466` samples). This is the CI critical
path; `ide test` totals `~65 s` here:

- `c_frontend_tests` is `72.7%` of the sanitized run (`47.7 s` by
  `TEST_MODULE_TIMING`); `x86_64_metadata_tests` is the only other large module
  at `23.5%` (`15.4 s`). Everything else together is under `4%`.
- **Half of `c_frontend_tests` is ASan's memcpy shadow check.**
  `QuickCheckForUnpoisonedRegion`, inlined into `___interceptor_memcpy` in
  `libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.so`, is `50.3%` of the module's samples.
- Charging that sanitizer cost to the buster frame that provokes it, the module
  is dominated by two one-line predicates in
  `src/buster/lib/compiler/frontend/c/c.c`:
  `c_token_is_punctuator` (`46.3%`) and `c_token_spelling_equal` (`21.4%`),
  then `string_equal` (`8.9%`), `c_ir_label_metadata_store_for_place` (`3.2%`),
  `c_ir_lower_assignment_statement_step` (`2.8%`) and
  `c_type_parse_parenthesized_step` (`2.7%`).
- Mechanism: `CToken` is a 40-byte aggregate passed **by value** into
  `c_token_is_punctuator`, which forwards it **by value again** to
  `c_token_spelling_equal`. At `-O0` clang materializes each by-value aggregate
  argument with a real `call memcpy` (visible in the disassembly of
  `c_token_is_punctuator`, alongside a per-call `__asan_stack_malloc_1`), and
  under ASan every one of those goes through the interceptor and its shadow
  scan. The predicate itself is one enum compare plus one string compare.
- The same profile of an unsanitized Debug build has the same shape without the
  amplification: `c_token_is_punctuator` `38.9%`, `string_equal` `16.8%`,
  `c_token_spelling_equal` only `4.7%`. Sanitizing multiplies the module by
  `3.8x` overall and concentrates the extra cost on the by-value token copies.
- Cost by call site inside `c_frontend_tests` (sanitized): `c_test.c:7229`
  `30.1%`, `:6974` `18.1%`, `:7166` `14.6%`, `:6726` `13.3%`, `:6312` `9.1%`,
  `:7227` `4.3%`. Five of these six are the `c_lower_to_ir`/`c_parse` calls of
  the inline stress blocks; `c_lower_to_ir` accounts for roughly `68%` of the
  module and `c_parse` for `21%`.
- Method validation (independent, non-sampling): direct
  `timestamp_take()` brackets around those call sites in the *same* process
  agree with the sampled shares to within `0.04` percentage points sanitized
  (`7229` `30.99%` measured vs `31.03%` sampled; `6974` `19.76`/`19.77`; `7166`
  `14.59`/`14.61`; `6726` `12.24`/`12.25`; `6312` `8.45`/`8.42`; `7227`
  `4.01`/`4.03`) and to within `0.3` points unsanitized. Every extracted return
  address disassembles to the instruction immediately after a `call` to the
  callee the callchain names.
- **Correction to an earlier note:** `c_test.c:7227` is *not* ~70% of
  `c_frontend_tests`. It is `4.3%` sanitized and `3.6%` unsanitized
  (`0.49 s` of `13.8 s` by direct timing). The `~70%` figure came from
  `perf script -F ip,sym,srcline`, whose raw-return-address resolution shifts
  every call site by 1–2 lines. The dominant single site is `c_test.c:7229`,
  the `c_lower_to_ir` of the same vla-assembly stress block — so the block was
  identified correctly and the line and magnitude were not.

`2026-08-02` (Linux x86_64, Release + Debug, with `--instrument --time-trace`):

- `build/Release` compile time is currently dominated by the unity TU:
  `CMakeFiles/ide.dir/Release/src/buster/apps/ide/ide.c.o` at `20613 ms`
  in `ninja_log_summary build --limit 20`.
- `build/Debug` split compilation hotspots (same summary):
  `parser.c.o` (`707 ms`), `codegen.c.o` (`582 ms`), `analysis.c.o` (`475 ms`),
  `ir.c.o` (`361 ms`).
- Pre-refactor `bench_all` result snapshots (the default was the I/O mode):
  - Release: `BENCH_IO parse_all_tests iterations=200 files=59 min_ns=398673 median_ns=418340`.
  - Debug: `BENCH_IO parse_all_tests iterations=200 files=59 min_ns=941358 median_ns=975512`.
- In `BUSTER_INSTRUMENT` mode:
  - Tokenize: `55_363 ns` median (Release), `297_607 ns` median (Debug).
  - Parse: `48_272 ns` median (Release), `340_853 ns` median (Debug).
- Pre-refactor `BENCH_FILE` output was consistently slowest-first; `tests/basic_variadic.bbb`
  is the dominant long-tail input across both configs.
- Superluminal capture of the old `ide bench` shows `parser_parse_bench` paths flowing
  heavily through `file_read -> os_file_open -> __libc_open64`, indicating
  benchmark procedure repeatedly performs disk reads instead of amortizing source
  input.
- The two-mode benchmark now separates parser throughput from filesystem input;
  compare `BENCH_PARSE` and `BENCH_IO` using their mode-specific phase and
  per-file rows when investigating parser throughput.

`2026-08-02` (Linux x86_64, Release `bench_all`, `BUSTER_INSTRUMENT=1`):

- Before the two-mode refactor, an opt-in preloaded-source benchmark path produced:
  - `BENCH_IO parse_all_tests ... median_ns=421736` (baseline: `file_read` each iteration).
  - `BENCH_PARSE parse_all_tests ... median_ns=90831` (files memory-mapped once, then reused).
- The preloaded benchmark reduced total wall time by roughly `78.5%` (`421736 -> 90831`).
- Tokenize/parse split moved only modestly:
  - Baseline `BENCH_IO_PHASE tokenize` median: `57241`, parse median: `48711`.
  - Preloaded `BENCH_PARSE_PHASE tokenize` median: `50023`, parse median: `39756`.
- The remaining gap between modes is mostly filesystem read overhead in the old
  path; parser/tokenization itself improves only ~12–19%.
- The dominant input is still `tests/basic_variadic.bbb`, but its parse path also
  drops (median `11171 -> 10430`) under preloaded-source reuse.

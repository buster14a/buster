# lowering

Run commands and resolve source paths from the repository root. Follow the
[shared agent rules](../../AGENTS.md), including the 9700X lock and `cores`
requirements. [Command index](README.md).

## Selective lowering

`./build/compiler test-lowering --clang` compares selective function/object
emission planning with an independent graph oracle and Clang object symbols
on original, manually modeled C fixtures. `benchmark-lowering` measures
synthetic graph preparation and vector/scalar selection; use the shared 9700X
lock and pin timings to CPU 2.

On the source path, `check_program_select` (`c_check_program_select.c`) gives
the planner the checked program's definitions, roots and evaluated references,
and `-c` and the direct path lower what it selects. A constant `if`'s dead arm
is never written, as clang -O0 doesn't emit it (#1108, the lowering guide's
"Constant `if`s"): what only it reaches, a block-scope static it declares
among them, is neither selected nor checked for target features, so
`main.c`'s units emit no other unit's commands and a baseline build no
`BUSTER_VECTOR_PATH` kernel. `c_lowering_symbols.c`
compares an object's functions and objects with `clang -O0 -c`'s: `test-checker`
on fixtures of each kind of definition (functions, objects and string literals),
`test-c-testsuite --cross-check` on c-testsuite and `test-checker-corpus
--symbols` on any corpus. Every correctness run compiles the compiler's own
`main.c` with `build.sh`'s flags for a plain `-march=znver5` build, by `-c` and
by `--lower-all` (`--verify`, and the scalar path's `--lower-all` object the
vector path's byte for byte), and compares its symbols with clang's
(`test-checker-corpus --symbols-minimum 1`), so that it keeps compiling both
ways. `benchmark-lowering-source [--passes N]
[preprocessor options] file...` measures what lowering only the referenced
definitions saves against `--lower-all`, after checking, with each file's
functions and objects defined, lowered and skipped. It times warm selection,
lowering and object construction in memory, with unwind generation and
verification disabled; it excludes checking and file writing. A file the checker rejects,
or that is refused by name (`CHECK_PROGRAM_UNSUPPORTED`,
`CHECK_DATA_UNSUPPORTED`), is left out; any other failure, a timed run that
lowers other than its warm-up, and a run that measures no file fail the command
(`test-checker` checks each, `c_lowering_source_benchmark_test.c`). Run it under
the 9700X's lock with `taskset -c 2`. [The lowering guide](../../docs/c-lowering.md) records the
contract, the comparisons' results and the completed `main.c` measurement.

## Node templates (#1048)

`./build/compiler measure-lowering-templates [--top N] [--keys N] [--abstracts N]
[--ignore-tracking] [--allow CATEGORY]... [preprocessor options] file...`
(`c_check_lower_inventory.c`) is #1048's inventory of node templates: each
file's selected definitions lowered by the task loop with every entry's owner
(`check_program_lower_owners`, the `-g` path's tokens replaced by owners through
`CheckLowerWriter.owners`, which no compile sets) and again without, which must
give the same entries; each node's key from the columns and its pattern; the
exceptions by category; the coverage of the deterministic keys and of their
abstract patterns; the bodies without an exception; and the maximal subtrees of
template nodes. It counts rather than times, so it needs no lock beyond the
build's. `test-checker` checks it on a fixture (`c_check_lower_inventory_test.c`).
The lowering guide's "Node templates over a body: the inventory (#1048)" has
`sqlite3.c`'s, Lua's and `main.c`'s results and what the design takes from them.

`c_check_program_templates.c` is #1048's template path in scalar form: before a
body's statements, a scatter gives each node's operands their contexts and
targets by its op's rule (`check_lower_template_rules`), then each node on its
own is classified, by the fast twin of the common shapes
(`check_lower_template_fast`) or the general rules, writes its entries into a
slot, and is marked closed or not, whose slots the task loop splices when it
pops their roots in those contexts (`check_lower_template_splice`). The task
loop stays the exact rules. No compile takes it (`CheckLowerShared.templates`):
these scalar steps cost about what they save, so they wait for data-parallel
ones. `./build/compiler test-lowering-templates [--passes N] [preprocessor
options] file...` (`c_check_program_templates_test.c`) lowers each file by the
tasks and with the templates forced (`check_program_lower_templates`), on any
host, requires every function's entries, locals, calls and arguments to be the
same and the fast twin to classify every node it takes as the general rules do
(its `check`), and with `--passes N` times both; `test-checker` runs it on
fixtures. `--time-stages`' `lowering-nodes` line reports the nodes and entries
the templates took. A change to `check_lower_expand`'s rules for what the table
takes changes the templates too: run the command on `sqlite3.c`, Lua and
c-testsuite. [The lowering guide](../../docs/c-lowering.md)'s "Node templates
over a body: the first path (#1048)" has the coverage and the measurements.

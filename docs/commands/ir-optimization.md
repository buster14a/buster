# ir-optimization

Run commands and resolve source paths from the repository root. Follow the
[shared agent rules](../../AGENTS.md), including the 9700X lock and `cores`
requirements. [Command index](README.md).

## Module overview

- The shared IR optimizers provide SCCP, dead-code/CFG cleanup, value numbering
  and conservative loop-invariant motion, private-field replacement and bounded
  translation-unit inlining. `test-ir-optimize`, `test-ir-gvn`, `test-ir-licm`,
  `test-ir-sroa` and `test-ir-inline` verify transformations against independent
  semantic fixtures and the upstream SSA promoter; `test-ir-optimize` also runs
  #175's hand-written `tests/ir/optimize/*.ir` before/after pairs in the text form
  through both parser paths, both twins, the canonical printer and the
  independent executor (`--print-text` prints them for review).
  `benchmark-ir-optimize`
  and `benchmark-ir-optimize-passes` include preparation and rewriting costs.
  [The optimization guide](../../docs/ir-optimization.md) records supported inputs
  and the source-corpus and target measurements still required for #139.

# Implicit postorder syntax tree

[Frontend index](../frontend.md) · [Issue #3102](https://github.com/buster14a/buster/issues/3102)

`c_ast_build` (`src/buster/lib/compiler/frontend/c/c_ast.c`, contract in
`c_ast.h`) reads a unit's final expanded token stream once, front to back, and
appends a complete syntax tree as it goes. The tree covers declarations and
declarators, statements, expressions, initializers and designators,
attributes, assembly and the supported GNU/C23 forms, function bodies
included. **Status: pilot.** Nothing in the production pipeline calls it yet.
`c_parse_ast`, `c_analyze_semantics_only` and `c_lower_to_ir_with_options`
still rediscover syntax from token ranges, as described in the
[foundations guide](foundations.md). The consumer map below lists which
walkers this tree is meant to retire, and what has to be shown before any of
them move.

## Representation

The tree is stored in postorder. Each subtree is one contiguous interval of
node indices, a node's children come before it, and the node that roots a
subtree is the last one in its interval. Topology needs one field,
`extents[n]`: the number of nodes in n's subtree, n included. A node's
subtree begins at `n + 1 - extents[n]`. Its last child is `n - 1`, and each
earlier child starts just before the previous one, at
`child - extents[child]`. The tree stores no parent or sibling links.

Nodes are structure-of-arrays rows:

| Column | Bytes | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kinds` | 1 | `CAstKind` |
| `extents` | 4 | subtree node count |
| `tokens` | 4 | provenance anchor: final-stream token index (operator, keyword, name or first token, per kind) |
| `data` | 4 | per-kind payload: interned symbol, `CAstWord`, presence bits and flags, or list word |

`C_AST_KIND_LIST` is the only authority for each kind's child contract. It
has five contract classes:

- **leaf:** no children.
- **fixed:** a set number of children, read by position.
- **range:** a minimum and maximum child count; when the trailing child is optional, its absence is the shorter count.
- **presence:** each optional child has a bit in the low byte of `data`, and children appear in source order.
- **list:** fixed leading children, a variadic middle and fixed trailing children. In the implicit layout, `data` holds the middle count.

`c_ast_validate` checks every contract, the extent tiling and the layout
slices.

Facts are produced once and stored with the node:
- Identifier-like nodes carry their interned symbol.
- Keyword specifiers carry a normalized `CAstWord`, so `__const__` and `const` are one word while the token keeps the spelling.
- A string-literal run is one node whose `data` holds the run length.
- Pointer and array qualifiers are flags.

Parentheses, commas and other punctuation get no nodes. A cast and a
compound literal differ by kind, so neither needs a separate marker.

## Construction

The builder is an explicit frame machine. A dispatch loop advances the top
frame, which may push child frames. No frame's step function calls another
step, so the C stack does not grow with nesting depth. Every open construct
records the append position where its subtree began. When the grammar commits
the construct, its node is appended with extent `append + 1 - begin`. Because
the parent is appended last, its kind is decided at that moment: a
declaration that turns out to be a function definition, or a parenthesis that
turns out to be a cast or compound literal, needs no rewrite. The builder
never reads an emitted node back.

Expressions use shunting-yard over an operator stack and an operand-begin
stack. Postfix operators apply immediately, prefix operators and casts are
right-associative, `?:` and the assignment family are right-associative, and
the middle operand of a conditional is a nested full-expression frame.
Declarators keep a stack of pointer prefixes per nesting level and emit them
after that level's suffixes, the `*` nearest the name first, so for any
declarator the chain from its name to the root reads in type-derivation
order.

The cursor reads at most `C_AST_LOOKAHEAD` tokens ahead. Two cases need the
full lookahead: `identifier :` at a statement start, and the decision after
`(` between a type name and an expression. With `CAstOptions.refill_batch` at
zero (the production setting) the window borrows the token array in place.
Any other value copies tokens through a ring that is refilled that many
tokens at a time. Tests build the same input at several batch sizes and
require identical trees, which checks that no grammar rule reads beyond the
window. That property is the precondition for feeding the builder from a
streaming preprocessor instead of a complete token array; see
[Remaining migration](#remaining-migration).

## Names that change the parse

The builder decides typedef names against ordinary identifiers when it reaches
each declaration point. It keeps one meaning byte per symbol (none, typedef,
ordinary) and an undo log with scope marks. A scope is opened for:
- the file;
- each prototype parameter list;
- each function body, which first re-declares the parameter names of the
  innermost function derivation and any K&R identifier list;
- each compound statement, `for` statement and statement-expression body.

A declarator's name becomes visible when its declarator completes (C17
6.2.1p7), so `int T = sizeof(T);` inside a typedef's scope already sees the
object. An enumerator becomes visible after its value. An identifier is a
typedef-name specifier only if no type specifier has appeared earlier in the
same specifier sequence. Labels, tags and members never bind.

The builder decides no types and binds no other identifier uses. Semantic
completion owns those, and will consume nodes instead of token ranges once it
is migrated.

## Storage and lifetime

During construction, columns grow in fixed-size chunks in the phase arena.
They are then sealed into the caller's arena as exact-sized contiguous arrays,
one copy per column. The phase arena is released afterwards, or a private one
is retired. `CAstStatistics` reports the retained bytes, the transient high
water mark and the bytes copied by sealing. On the first syntax error the
build records one structured diagnostic and publishes an empty tree, so a
partial tree is never handed on. The tree refers to the preprocessing result's
tokens and symbols by index, so that result must stay alive as long as the
tree does.

## Layouts

`CAstOptions.layout` selects a variant of the same tree:

- **Implicit:** extents only.
- **Hybrid:** in addition, each list node gets a child-root slice; its `data`
  becomes the slice offset, and the count is read from the slice.
- **Explicit:** the compact explicit-index control. Every interior node gets
  a slice through `CAst.slices`.

The forward pass always produces the implicit form. The hybrid and explicit
variants are built afterwards in one finalization pass, and that pass is
included in their measured cost. The accessors `c_ast_child_count`,
`c_ast_list_count`, `c_ast_child_at`, `c_ast_children` and `c_ast_walk_*`
return the same answers for every layout.

A consumer can traverse the tree in three ways:
1. A plain postorder scan over `kinds`. This works where operands are
   evaluated before their operator, as in constant folding and most
   expression typing.
2. `c_ast_walk_next` enter/exit events on an explicit stack. Context that must
   be set before a child is visited goes on the enter event: branch arms,
   short-circuit operands, unevaluated operands, scopes.
3. Direct child access by position.

## Consumer and retirement map

These token walkers currently rediscover structure that the tree records once.
A row may be retired only when its consumer reads nodes and the corresponding
differential tests pass.

| Current owner | Rediscovers | Tree replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `c_parse_ast_run`, `c_parser_parse_function_body`, `c_parser_parse_declaration_expression` | declaration split, declarator name, body range, static-assert ranges | `DECLARATION`, `FUNCTION_DEFINITION`, `INIT_DECLARATOR`, `STATIC_ASSERT` |
| `c_parse_statement_end`, `c_parse_bind_block_statements`, `c_parse_local_declarations` | statement boundaries, block declarations | `COMPOUND_STATEMENT` items |
| `c_type_parse_*` declarator/specifier machine | specifiers, pointer/array/function derivations | `DECL_SPECIFIERS`, `DECLARATOR_*`, `TYPE_NAME` |
| `c_parse_direct_expression_type`, `c_type_parse_sizeof_step` | operator precedence (top-down lowest-operator rescans) | expression nodes in postorder |
| `c_ir_lower_body_advance`, `c_ir_statement_end*` | first-token statement classification, controlled-body extents | statement nodes |
| `c_ir_lower_expression_core_step`, `c_ir_has_root_*`, `c_ir_root_conditional` | shunting-yard precedence, root comma/assignment/conditional splits | expression roots |
| `c_ir_predict_expression_type*`, `c_ir_query_*` | type-name probes, operand types over token ranges | `TYPE_NAME` / `CAST` / `SIZEOF_*` nodes plus retained semantic facts |
| `c_ir_build_delimiter_index`, `CTokenPositionIndex` matching delimiters | bracket matching for every structural query | subtree extents |

## Measurement plan

Comparisons are between matched endpoints only. The pilot's tree is
complete, but nothing consumes it yet, so it cannot be compared against
today's checked frontend as an end-to-end result. Hosted measurements are
diagnostic. Acceptance needs the Ryzen 7 9700X route required by
[#2761](https://github.com/buster14a/buster/issues/2761) and described in
[benchmarking](../benchmarking.md).

For the pilot, the budgets for the self-host unity input (about 3.97 M tokens
reach the parser) were declared before any timing was taken:
- the implicit build costs at most 2× `c_parse_ast` on the same token stream,
  median of paired runs;
- the implicit layout retains at most 16 bytes per final-stream token;
- the transient high-water mark is at most one chunk per column plus frames,
  stacks and bindings.

The hybrid and explicit layouts are reported against the implicit one. Their
build and traversal costs are measured, not budgeted.

Results are recorded in a performance audit (`tools/new_audit.py`), not here.

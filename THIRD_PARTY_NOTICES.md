# Provenance and third-party notices

Reviewed October 20, 2026 against all 30 tracked files at
[`c7eadb9989c48767f81c51a3b052a136bbb436ec`](https://github.com/buster14a/buster-fast/tree/c7eadb9989c48767f81c51a3b052a136bbb436ec).
The earlier issue pin `d13038574531b064cc87b133bb97665d1728f60a` differs only
in `.github/workflows/9700x.yml`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/coding-style.md`.
Those changes add the C-language rule, Markdown-only CI exclusion and stable
repository-ID check, with no new imported implementation. The latter is the
only change since the initial inventory at `76cab868a233fb81dac33933861a7b7d8d554649`.
This adoption adds legal texts, documentation
and source comments; it changes no executable statements.

The first-party grant and maintainer's historical-authority confirmation are
in [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md). The inventory distinguishes provenance from
that confirmation. Existing upstream grants authorize the identified imports;
the maintainer's confirmation does not purport to grant anyone else's rights.

## Path and portion inventory

Paths below are relative to the repository root. "Default" means
`Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception` for original material.

| Paths or portions | Origin and disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `src/buster/compiler/c_lexer.c` | Adapted/generated Accelerated-Zig-Parser lexer, with simdjson, Clang and identifier-data provenance described below; component terms, not the first-party default over the whole file. |

| `LICENSE`, `DCO`, `LICENSES/*` | Retained legal/attribution texts; their own terms. These are not original project prose. |

## Accelerated-Zig-Parser and simdjson

Source: [davidgmbb/Accelerated-Zig-Parser at
`f4482e2dd53413522d75d8c254b9a824021238ce`](https://github.com/davidgmbb/Accelerated-Zig-Parser/tree/f4482e2dd53413522d75d8c254b9a824021238ce).
The exact root license is retained as
[LICENSES/Accelerated-Zig-Parser.txt](LICENSES/Accelerated-Zig-Parser.txt),
including **Copyright (c) 2023 Niles Salter**, the MIT grant and the Apache-2.0
terms for marked simdjson/simdjzon-derived portions.

`c_lexer.c` combines `c/c_tokenizer.h`, `c/c_tokenizer_tables.h`,
`c/c_tokenizer_unicode.h`, `c/c_tokenizer_scalar.c` and `c/c_tokenizer.c`.
Import commit `6c602cd` and its section markers identify them. The lexer tests
and benchmark come from `c/c_tokenizer_test.c` (local commits `832eaf8` and
`d89d63e`). Local formatting, bounds handling, command integration, tests and
optimizations are modifications; the source headers and Git history record
them. The embedded upstream license is retained.

The upstream C implementation was introduced in `d0c062147011361411d1677eaec9bf69a3881bf8`
after the compacting-tokenizer port in
`178a2d27fe7a50d642cb0a48f193ee9723f49633`. That port identifies Niles Salter's
MIT-licensed compacting-tokenizer work and retains his 2024 notice. Both the
2023 license notice and **Copyright (c) 2024 Niles Salter** are retained here.
The reviewed fork's C changes were made by the maintainer and his agent.

The backslash-run calculation in `c_lexer.c`'s `classify` identifies John
Keiser's simdjson algorithm. The upstream Zig port links
[simdjson PR #2042](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/pull/2042), merged as
`9408298e0e64fbfe79b178278b58d81bc81eb7af`; its
`src/generic/stage1/json_escape_scanner.h` is the reference. That source uses
Apache-2.0 without the LLVM exception. Its author attribution (Daniel Lemire,
Geoff Langdale, John Keiser) is retained verbatim in
[LICENSES/simdjson-AUTHORS.txt](LICENSES/simdjson-AUTHORS.txt).
The examined simdjson revision and lexer import have no separate root `NOTICE`.
The upstream license also names simdjzon; no separately copied simdjzon file
was identified among the five imported C files. That upstream statement is
preserved, not narrowed or removed.

The MIT benchmark helper lineage extends beyond the lexer: the counter-open
and counter-read routines and clock sample in `x86_64_encoder_benchmark.c`
match the imported harness after renaming; the object writer benchmark uses
the same pattern. Their insertion-sort helpers, also used by
`lane_benchmark.c`, follow the local lexer benchmark. These portions and local
changes to them remain MIT; the rest of those benchmark files uses Default.

### Generated tables and Clang-following code

`c/gen_c_tokenizer_tables.py` generates the byte-property, operator and
punctuator tables from `c/c_tokenizer.h` and explicit C/C++ character rules.
It reads no external instruction or Unicode database. Those generated
representations follow the imported component's MIT terms.

`c/gen_c_tokenizer_unicode.py` instead probes every nonsurrogate non-ASCII
code point using `clang -cc1 -std=c23 -dump-raw-tokens`, then coalesces accepted
code points into ranges. The imported header records **clang 23.1.3**, with
695 start and 812 continue ranges. It is not output licensed solely by the
generator's own terms.

The scalar lexer explicitly follows Clang's `clang/lib/Lex/Lexer.cpp` and
names corresponding routines. Preserve LLVM's existing terms for any adapted
expression in those portions and the identifier-data representation:
[LICENSES/LLVM.txt](LICENSES/LLVM.txt) is the exact LLVM license from
[`llvmorg-23.1.3`, commit `0d261d1ca552c95a8f007e061c787ac7132fbcbc`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/0d261d1ca552c95a8f007e061c787ac7132fbcbc).
The corresponding `Lexer.cpp` and `UnicodeCharSets.h` carry
`Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception`. The local changes are a C translation with
bounded slices, simplified diagnostics and different storage/control flow.
These existing LLVM terms are not the new first-party grant.

The range data reflects Unicode identifier properties plus Clang's
mathematical-notation extensions. Retain the Unicode data notice as well:
**Copyright © 1991-2026 Unicode, Inc.** and the complete
[Unicode License V3](LICENSES/Unicode-3.0.txt), copied from
[Unicode's license](https://www.unicode.org/license.txt).
This preserves data rights without asserting that all output of a compiler
inherits its implementation license.

The generator recorded a version string, not a hash of the Clang binary or an
independent Unicode input manifest. The LLVM tag above is the review
comparison pin, not a claim to have recovered that binary. The imported table
bytes and generator are pinned by the lexer revision; retain all these terms
when redistributing them. Regeneration must record the actual tool and inputs.

## RAD Debugger

The lane interface/base-layer reference is
[RAD Debugger at `62b715a30e5da6b8d7e02372a8e7458feab1df97`](https://github.com/EpicGames/raddebugger/tree/62b715a30e5da6b8d7e02372a8e7458feab1df97),
the upstream revision preceding the October 19 lane implementation.
The reviewed paths are `src/base/base_thread_context.{h,c}`,
`src/base/base_math.c`, `src/base/base_arena.{h,c}`,
`src/radbin/radbin.c` and `src/rdi_from_pdb/rdi_from_pdb.c`.
They carry **Copyright (c) Epic Games Tools** and MIT terms, retained verbatim
in [LICENSES/RAD-Debugger.txt](LICENSES/RAD-Debugger.txt).

Local commit `f72863b` and [PR #72](https://github.com/buster14a/buster-fast/pull/72)
identify that reference. Lane metadata, scratch arenas, modulo task assignment
and equal-range partitioning follow those interfaces/patterns. The local
barrier, one-barrier broadcast, caller-as-lane-zero startup, bounded arena
allocation, cost partitioning and `mwaitx`/futex waiting differ substantially.
Keep the upstream MIT notice and provide the entire modified `lane.c` under
MIT instead of requiring a disputed line-by-line originality boundary.

The original implementation consulted `master` without retaining a commit
hash. The pin above is the historical source comparison used in this review;
it is not presented as a recovered original checkout identifier. Both the
referenced interface and inspected implementation have the same MIT grant.

## Encoder, tools and other generated material

[PR #14](https://github.com/buster14a/buster-fast/pull/14), introducing the
encoder in `55f05ac`, explicitly records that no code was copied from
`buster14a/bloat-buster`'s historical encoder at
`e9b3dea9429996c7ad492d80a4923e75126ada87`. That implementation was an external
comparison, not a vendored component.

The early encoder document proposed generating a future table from the
original Buster catalogue. The subsequent implementation uses handwritten
X-macro rows/families, checked against GNU as. The reviewed tree contains
neither a XED/uops.info data projection nor that catalogue. Issue
[#17](https://github.com/buster14a/buster-fast/issues/17) uses XED and
uops.info's March 29, 2026 list for coverage research; this does not itself
establish a copied implementation. GNU as 2.47's output bytes/relocations are
test oracles for the locally authored streams; no GNU as implementation is
included. Future generated imports require a fresh input/notice review.

`link_program.c` emits original synthetic support routines and fixtures;
the executable's hash constants are generated from SplitMix64, not imported
test corpora. Recognizable SplitMix64 arithmetic also appears in link/lane/
executable tests and benchmarks, and in the dataflow generator's seed mixer.
The public-domain reference is
[Sebastiano Vigna's 2015 implementation](https://prng.di.unimi.it/splitmix64.c);
its dedication, permission and disclaimer are retained in
[LICENSES/SplitMix64.txt](LICENSES/SplitMix64.txt). This does not import the
Java implementation referenced by that source. No runtime or system header
package is vendored at this revision.

The concrete older-Buster import is `.claude/settings.json`, recorded by
`02a1ad65e157c9cb1affc0293c7ab4a6fe21fe0b`. Its allowlist matches the maintainer's
configuration at Buster commit `5180a65a57ef19e9a2b5251eb33356e57b7120e1`, with
the repository name changed and local Tailscale permissions added. This is
maintainer configuration under his confirmed contribution authority, not an
import of the older compiler's frameworks or implementation.

## Review limits and distribution

The record covers the pinned tree and this adoption's changes. Unmerged PRs,
future imports and external system libraries are not silently covered.
Unrecorded original tool hashes are identified above; the retained compatible
component terms are the disposition for those portions, rather than an
assertion that they are entirely first-party.

Preserve source attribution/modification notices and distribute the applicable
license and notice files as described in [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
Excluding something from the first-party grant would not by itself authorize
redistributing it. Any later discovery of other incorporated material must be
resolved before claiming coverage for it.
